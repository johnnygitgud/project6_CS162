Show me that you can sort data For example, we could:

Create a list of 100 numbers and show the sort working at each step of it:

    comparing values,

    swapping values,

    essentially showing a report of all the steps needed to sort a list.

Alternatively, we could get some practice with a GUI and sort 10 graphical rectangles:

    Create a collection of 10 int values,

    Create a GUI to display the collection of int values as rectangles,

    Include a button to start the sort process,

    Highlight the candidate value(s) both before and after moving the value(s) at each step of the sorting process,

    Pause after highlighting the candidate value(s)(before and after moving, possibly with different colors),
    (perhaps for 100-250ms based on a speed button or slider?)

    Make it obvious when it has finished sorting the data set.
    (perhaps things flash, a border appears around the data set, or something pops up saying it completed)

What kinds of tests would be useful for this?  How could we test some of it to verify that it was working properly?

Implement some of those tests in PyTest!

Take a screenshot of each of the numbered items being demonstrated above;
Highlight, underline, or otherwise make obvious the item you are highlighting;
Explain in a sentence or two how your code accomplished that item (you can show a snip of code if it makes it easier to explain).
